    <h1>Let Me Tell You Why You Should Play <em>Magical Warrior Diamond Heart</em> Because I Really Think You Should</h1>

    <h2>as written for my web design class final but i'm leaving it because i still think you should play <em>Magical Warrior Diamond Heart</em></h2>

    <p>I've fallen in love with <em>Magical Warrior Diamond Heart</em> and now I'm making it your problem. The game's still being made, but there's a demo of what's available that's free to download, and a Patreon-exclusive peek at the DLC if you want to support the game. Anyways, here's 4 reasons you should check this game out.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>1. Magical boy characters</h2>
    <br>

    <br>
    <section class="section1">
        As an avid <em>Pretty Cure</em> fan, this is still a pretty huge deal to me. <br> Two of the 7 Crystal
        Warriors, Alex Harvey and Liam Farrow, are young men.
        They aren't particularly feminine in their regular forms, but are confident donning the frills and bows of the
        Crystal Warrior uniform.
        As a guy myself, it's nice to see characters who are physically like me depicted in this way.
        <br>
        Not that I think mainstream magical girl media necessarily needs to include characters like Alex or Liam or otherwise pander to people like me, though. I'm nowhere close to their target demographic, and that's fine. I'm just happy to see stuff like this done seriously rather than as a joke.

    <h2>2. Variety of the cast's backgrounds and identities<br></h2>
    <br>

    <br>
    <section class="section1">
        Everyone in the main cast comes from a different background and brings with them their own traditions and
        worldviews.
        Seeing everyone play off each other in interesting ways because of their backgrounds is part of the charm of
        this game, and much like everything else it's really well done.
        <br>
        <br>
        <center><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/646005d21918ea134d1e0489/t/64a5ad760f7d2d129924f4cb/1688579449426/val_pink.png", width="480", height="290" title="Valerie Amaranth, looking warmly at the viewer."></center>
        <br>
        Also, every main character is canonically LGBTQ+ in some way, another thing <em>Pretty Cure</em> will probably never even get close to doing.
        For example, the viewpoint character Valerie Amaranth is pansexual.
        Because of this she can romance everyone in the cast, which might seem like a contrivance when I'm explaining it
        here, but in the game it's just another part of what makes Val a lovable protagonist. She frequently gets flustered by how
        attractive all her friends look, which just adds to her charm. To me, stuff like this makes the cast feel more three-dimensional and really brings the world to life.

    <h2>3. Fantastic art and music</h2>
    <br>

    <section class="section1">
        Pyonkotchi does not miss when it comes to the art. The character designs are all fantastic. Each character has
        their own style, and Pyon captures them perfectly.
        The edited and commissioned backgrounds are realistic enough to create some truly eerie contrast with the ambience the
        Nightmare Agency brings when they attack, but still stylized to not clash with Pyon's incredible character art.
        Even the placeholder backgrounds for the ones that haven't been finalized yet are mostly decent.
        The game's menus are also fantastic.
        <br>
        And the music? Every track is incredible. Everyone in the cast has their own theme, with Crystal Warriors getting both their regular themes and a version that plays in their battles.
        The OST is mostly commissioned, as far as I can tell, but it's clear Pyon knows how to pick 'em. I've listened to a few of these tracks on loop for actual hours. Even now as I'm typing this, I'm listening to Valerie's battle theme!

    <h2>4. Intriguing story<br></h2>
    <br>

    <section class="section1">
        The game is only a demo so far, but the story is already really interesting. 
        The premise is typical magical girl fare, almost like it's taken straight from <em>Pretty Cure.</em> A fairy from another world, Diana, comes to Earth to find Crystal Warriors who can help her
        save the kingdom of Chalcedonia and find Princess Rosalia, who has powerful magic the evil Nightmare Agency wants to use to unseal the Princess of Darkness. 
        Valerie dreams of the attack on Chalcedonia, and after a mundane day of school is suddenly thrust into battle against a Nightmare Agent and his Nightmare monster when she catches Diana falling from the sky.
        Gathering a group of friends and fellow Crystal Warriors, she defends the city as Diamond Heart, the crystal of love and hope, while also navigating high school and the intricacies of her relationships with her new friends.
        <br><br>
        However, below the surface of daily life and the fights against the Nightmare Agency, there's mysterious forces at work. 
        Valerie often finds herself saying weird things or having weird dreams, and she feels very ill when Nightmares attack, something that (according to the team's fairies) shouldn't be affecting a normal human, even if they're a Crystal Warrior. She also possesses strange abilities compared to her allies, which only makes me more curious!
        I'm super excited to see this mystery demystifed! I think the way it's being built up so far is super cool.
