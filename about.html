        <h1>Heya!</h1>
        I'm BlueDogXL! I also go by Dusty in some places, and if you don't have much time you can just call me Blue.
        <br>
        I'm a guy, and my pronouns are he/him.
        <br>
        I'm plugging away at a Game Programming degree! I'm at the point where I can mostly understand what's going on when I make a silly mistake, but I still usually need help fixing it. C'est la vie, I guess.

                    I just got really interested in magical girl stuff a few years ago out of nowhere! I've seen <em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em> and the <em>Eternal</em> movies, <em>Tokyo Mew Mew New</em>, and most <em>Pretty Cure</em> seasons. I'm also following the development of the visual novel <em><a href="magicalwarriordiamondheart.com">Magical Warrior Diamond Heart</a>!</em>
                    <br><br>
                    I think my top 5 recommendations would be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Kira Kira Pretty Cure A La Mode</li><br>
                        <li>2. Futari wa Pretty Cure (and Futari wa Pretty Cure Max Heart)</li><br>
                        <li>3. Tokyo Mew Mew New</li><br>
                        <li>4. Magical Warrior Diamond Heart (so far)</li><br>
                        <li>5. Sailor Moon Crystal (specifically season 3 and the movies, the first two seasons are kind of eh)</li><br>
                    </ul>
                </td>
